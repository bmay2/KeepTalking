# KeepTalking

Use this application to listen to input from your device's microphone and track prolonged silences during a specified period of time. You may find this application useful if you are trying to improve your ability to consistently talk aloud while doing some other task.

You can specify:

1) the total length of time the program is running/listening

2) the length of a silence, after which your device's output plays...

3) the alerting audio file

Enjoy!
